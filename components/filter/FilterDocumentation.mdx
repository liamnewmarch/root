# Filter

Root Filter is based on Web Audio API's BiquadFilterNode. 

The filter currently offers a lowpass and hipass filter with rolloff set to -12 (default).

```html
<root-filter recieveFrom="osc-1" sendTo-"output"></root-filter>
```
<Story id="components-filter--basic" />

This filter makes use of Root Fader's quadratic function - so the frequency input range moves from 10hz to 20KHz, according to the human hearing range.
