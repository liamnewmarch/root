# Web Audio Component Library - Potato Labs


## Background
The web audio guild has been working on a synth inspired by the use of reusable web components from this video — [Declarative Web Audio API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K6GiLusIV0). 
Whilst building one of the components, they realised that there are few to no inspirations for building UI for audio components. 
Most audio components on the web tend to use knobs or linear input ranges instead of logarithmic scales or frequency to amplitude input change.


## Goal
Taking inspiration from UI libraries like Google’s Glue or Twitter’s bootstrap, we could like to build a UI library for web audio components. The future version of this is going to be open-source.

## Days to complete:
9 days (about 1 full sprint)

## Components to be built

### Filter
- Logarithmic input range
- Linear for Q, gain
- Dropdown for Filter Types
- On/Off switch
- Graphical representation
- Nice to have: Interactive graphical rep, spectrum analyser

### Keyboard:
- Looks like a piano
- Responds to mouse, computer keyboard and MIDI keyboard, touch
- Octave Switches
- Pitch bend, mod wheel
- Visual representation of key presses
- Nice to have: Responds to MIDI events from synth, i.e Arp compresses/lights up notes on the keyboard

### Oscillator:
- 2x oscillator nodes in the demo
- Default types: sine, sawtooth, square, off.
- Detune linear range knob.
- Visual representation of waveforms in dropdown.
- Gain for each oscillator node.
- Nice to have: Noise oscillator.

### Visualiser:
- Show a waveform
- Ability to customise colour of waveform and background
- Nice to have: Frequency vs time domain toggle
- Nice to have: axes and grid lines
